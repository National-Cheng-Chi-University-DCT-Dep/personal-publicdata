## Body: Forging Expertise in High-Stakes Environments

My journey into cybersecurity began during my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at National Cheng Chi University, where I specialized in network security and data analytics. A pivotal project involved developing an AI-based intrusion detection system for simulated enterprise networks, earning top honors in our department's capstone competition. This academic foundation quickly translated into real-world impact when my role as a Cybersecurity Consultant provided the opportunity to serve critical clients, most notably the TWSE. Over two years, I contributed to securing critical infrastructure against evolving threats, including ransomware campaigns targeting financial APIs and insider risk assessments using behavioral analytics. One standout achievement was optimizing a cloud-based threat intelligence platform that reduced false positives by 40%, enabling faster response times during peak trading volumes. These efforts honed my skills in Python scripting, SIEM tools like Splunk, and machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, but they also exposed the limitations of siloed approaches: software defenses alone cannot counter hardware-level exploits or quantum-era vulnerabilities.

Beyond technical proficiency, my role at TWSE immersed me in cross-functional collaboration, where I briefed C-suite executives on risk mitigation strategies and coordinated with international partners during joint exercises modeled after global cyber drills. This experience underscored the need for a holistic perspective—one that integrates policy, ethics, and cutting-edge research. It was here that my interest in quantum computing crystallized; reading about Shor's algorithm's potential to shatter RSA encryption during a late-night threat modeling session, I became determined to pioneer quantum-resistant systems. Yet, with Taiwan's vibrant tech ecosystem demanding immediate expertise, I sought a master's program that would not only deepen my cybersecurity acumen but also bridge to quantum frontiers. Aalto University, with its renowned legacy and forward-looking research hubs, represents that perfect convergence.
