# Statement of Purpose: MSc in Computer Science at Hochschule Darmstadt

## Hook: A Defining Moment in Digital Resilience

In the early hours of a routine night shift at the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), I watched as a sophisticated DDoS attack unfolded—not just a barrage of traffic, but a meticulously orchestrated assault on the heartbeat of Taiwan's financial ecosystem. As a consultant assigned to the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), I was on the frontline of defense during a sophisticated DDoS attack... In close coordination with their internal team, I helped lead the rapid deployment of mitigation strategies, drawing on machine learning models to filter anomalous patterns and restore system integrity within minutes. That night, as trading floors lit up with relief, I realized cybersecurity is not merely a technical pursuit; it is the invisible shield safeguarding economies, societies, and individual lives in an increasingly interconnected world. This experience ignited my passion for blending AI-driven defenses with emerging threats like quantum computing, propelling me toward Hochschule Darmstadt's MSc in Computer Science—a program uniquely positioned at the intersection of strategic innovation and practical resilience.

## Body: Forging Expertise in High-Stakes Environments

My journey into cybersecurity began during my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at National Cheng Chi University, where I specialized in network security and data analytics. A pivotal project involved developing an AI-based intrusion detection system for simulated enterprise networks, earning top honors in our department's capstone competition. This academic foundation quickly translated into real-world impact when my role as a Cybersecurity Consultant provided the opportunity to serve critical clients, most notably the TWSE. Over two years, I contributed to securing critical infrastructure against evolving threats, including ransomware campaigns targeting financial APIs and insider risk assessments using behavioral analytics. One standout achievement was optimizing a cloud-based threat intelligence platform that reduced false positives by 40%, enabling faster response times during peak trading volumes. These efforts honed my skills in Python scripting, SIEM tools like Splunk, and machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, but they also exposed the limitations of siloed approaches: software defenses alone cannot counter hardware-level exploits or quantum-era vulnerabilities.

Beyond technical proficiency, my role at TWSE immersed me in cross-functional collaboration, where I briefed C-suite executives on risk mitigation strategies and coordinated with international partners during joint exercises modeled after global cyber drills. This experience underscored the need for a holistic perspective—one that integrates policy, ethics, and cutting-edge research. It was here that my interest in quantum computing crystallized; reading about Shor's algorithm's potential to shatter RSA encryption during a late-night threat modeling session, I became determined to pioneer quantum-resistant systems. Yet, with Taiwan's vibrant tech ecosystem demanding immediate expertise, I sought a master's program that would not only deepen my cybersecurity acumen but also bridge to quantum frontiers. Hochschule Darmstadt, with its renowned legacy and forward-looking research hubs, represents that perfect convergence.

In bridging my professional background and future aspirations, this program emerges as the ideal pathway to advance my expertise in cybersecurity while building the foundation for my long-term research interests in quantum computing and AI-driven security systems. My extensive experience in securing critical infrastructure, most notably during my work with the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), has provided me with deep practical knowledge in threat detection, system resilience, and crisis response management.

The program's comprehensive curriculum directly addresses my need to deepen theoretical understanding while maintaining a strong practical focus. My hands-on experience with cloud security architectures, Zero Trust implementations, and AI-powered threat detection systems has highlighted the importance of combining cutting-edge research with real-world application—a philosophy that this program clearly embraces.

Furthermore, the university's research focus in cybersecurity and emerging technologies aligns perfectly with my career trajectory. Having worked extensively with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and deployed local AI systems using Ollama LLM, I am eager to explore how AI can be more effectively integrated into security systems while maintaining reliability and interpretability in high-stakes environments.

The program's emphasis on both technical excellence and strategic thinking resonates with my experience briefing C-suite executives and coordinating with international partners during cyber exercises. This combination of technical depth and strategic perspective is essential for addressing the complex, global nature of modern cybersecurity challenges.

Looking toward my long-term interest in quantum computing, this program provides an excellent foundation for understanding post-quantum cryptography and quantum-resistant security protocols. My prior work with IBM Quantum systems has given me initial exposure to quantum technologies, and I am excited to deepen this knowledge within the context of practical security applications.

Through this program, I will gain access to cutting-edge research opportunities while building the international network necessary to address global security challenges. The combination of rigorous academic training and practical application represents the optimal pathway for my professional development and contribution to the cybersecurity field.

## Future: Envisioning Impact in a Quantum-Secure World

Upon completing the MSc in Computer Science at Hochschule Darmstadt, I envision returning to Taiwan's tech sector as a senior cybersecurity architect, leveraging my enhanced expertise to fortify critical infrastructure against next-generation threats. In the short term, I aim to contribute to initiatives like Taiwan's National Cybersecurity Program, applying lessons from leading cybersecurity exercises and AI research to develop AI-enhanced defense frameworks that protect financial and governmental systems. This will position me to lead cross-industry collaborations, perhaps consulting for organizations like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), where hardware and quantum security intersect with global supply chains.

Looking further ahead, my Hochschule Darmstadt education will propel me toward a PhD in quantum security, potentially at institutions like the University of Waterloo or back at Hochschule Darmstadt through extended research collaborations. Ultimately, I aspire to pioneer quantum-resistant protocols in international standards bodies, such as contributing to ISO cybersecurity committees or founding a startup focused on post-quantum encryption for emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles and smart cities. By blending Hochschule Darmstadt's strategic insights with my passion for innovation, I am committed to shaping a resilient digital future—one where security empowers progress rather than hinders it. Hochschule Darmstadt is not just a step in my journey; it is the catalyst for turning my experiences into global impact.
