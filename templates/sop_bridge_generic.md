## Bridge: Why This Program—Aligning Professional Experience with Academic Goals

In bridging my professional background and future aspirations, this program emerges as the ideal pathway to advance my expertise in cybersecurity while building the foundation for my long-term research interests in quantum computing and AI-driven security systems. My extensive experience in securing critical infrastructure, most notably during my work with the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), has provided me with deep practical knowledge in threat detection, system resilience, and crisis response management.

The program's comprehensive curriculum directly addresses my need to deepen theoretical understanding while maintaining a strong practical focus. My hands-on experience with cloud security architectures, Zero Trust implementations, and AI-powered threat detection systems has highlighted the importance of combining cutting-edge research with real-world application—a philosophy that this program clearly embraces.

Furthermore, the university's research focus in cybersecurity and emerging technologies aligns perfectly with my career trajectory. Having worked extensively with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and deployed local AI systems using Ollama LLM, I am eager to explore how AI can be more effectively integrated into security systems while maintaining reliability and interpretability in high-stakes environments.

The program's emphasis on both technical excellence and strategic thinking resonates with my experience briefing C-suite executives and coordinating with international partners during cyber exercises. This combination of technical depth and strategic perspective is essential for addressing the complex, global nature of modern cybersecurity challenges.

Looking toward my long-term interest in quantum computing, this program provides an excellent foundation for understanding post-quantum cryptography and quantum-resistant security protocols. My prior work with IBM Quantum systems has given me initial exposure to quantum technologies, and I am excited to deepen this knowledge within the context of practical security applications.

Through this program, I will gain access to cutting-edge research opportunities while building the international network necessary to address global security challenges. The combination of rigorous academic training and practical application represents the optimal pathway for my professional development and contribution to the cybersecurity field.
