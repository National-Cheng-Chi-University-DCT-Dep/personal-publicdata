# Personal Statement: MSc in Cybercrime, Terrorism and Security
## Explains your interest in this area
- My interest in the nexus of cybercrime, terrorism, and security was forged not in theory, but in the crucible of defending a nation's critical financial infrastructure. As a consultant assigned to the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), I was on the frontline during a sophisticated DDoS attack. This was not a simple technical glitch; it was a meticulously orchestrated assault intended to destabilize the heartbeat of Taiwan's economy.
- In the intense hours that followed, as my team and I worked to restore system integrity, I was struck by a profound realization: the malicious code and traffic patterns were merely the weapons, not the actors. The true challenge lay in understanding the motivations, strategies, and organizational structures of the adversaries operating from the shadows. That night, I understood that to truly secure our world, one must look beyond the ones and zeros to understand the human motivations, criminal enterprises, and geopolitical forces that drive these attacks. This conviction is why I am drawn to the MSc in Cybercrime, Terrorism and Security.

- My five years of professional experience have been a continuous case study in the multifaceted nature of digital threats. When I contributed to securing financial APIs against ransomware campaigns, I was not just patching vulnerabilities; I was confronting the business models of organized international criminal syndicates.
- Similarly, conducting insider risk assessments using behavioral analytics was a practical application of criminological principles to prevent internal sabotage and corporate espionage.
- My work with high-stakes clients like the Taiwan Armed Forces Medical Bureau and Cathay Financial Holdings immersed me in the world of protecting critical data against sophisticated state and non-state actors. These experiences taught me that every line of malicious code tells a story about its creator’s resources, intentions, and geopolitical context.
-  However, they also revealed the limits of a purely technical approach. While I can architect a secure cloud network, I lack the formal framework to analyze the legal and ethical implications of cyber-espionage, the psychology of online radicalization, or the policy mechanisms for international cooperation against cyber threats. This Master's program is the essential bridge to fill that knowledge gap.

## Describes any relevant research experience
- My academic work has provided the analytical foundation for these practical skills. During my undergraduate studies in Management Information Systems at National Cheng Chi University, my research focused on network security and data analytics. For my capstone project, I led the development of an AI-based intrusion detection system for a simulated enterprise network, which earned the Best Popularity Award in our department's competition. This project was my first significant research experience in using machine learning not just to block attacks, but to understand the underlying patterns of malicious behavior. The research involved analyzing datasets of network traffic to differentiate the digital fingerprints of a lone actor from the coordinated signals of a botnet, which I now recognize as a foundational element of digital forensics and threat actor profiling.

- Furthermore, my graduate coursework at National Cheng Chi University (GPA 3.96/4.3) honed my ability to synthesize interdisciplinary concepts. A course in 'Design Theory and Methods', taught by a psychology professor, was particularly transformative. It taught me to apply principles of critical thinking and human-centered design to security problems, which directly relates to understanding criminal motivation and preventing social engineering—the "OSI Layer 8" of security. This experience cemented my belief that the most resilient security strategies are those that integrate deep technical knowledge with a sophisticated understanding of human behavior.

## Lists any academic work you have published or which is awaiting publication
- While I have not yet had the opportunity to submit work for formal academic publication, I have undertaken significant independent research as part of my graduate studies. My Master's thesis draft, for instance, delves into the complex challenge of simulating quantum entangled states, specifically modeling data and packet loss rates by considering factors such as distance, noise, and packet size.

- This research, available as a work-in-progress on my GitHub repo(https://github.com/dennislee928/thesis), represents my deep, proactive engagement with the theoretical underpinnings of next-generation information systems. The project allowed me to explore concepts from quantum information theory and apply them to practical problems in data transmission, solidifying my analytical and modeling skills. One of my primary motivations for pursuing the MSc in Cybercrime, Terrorism and Security is to build upon this research foundation and develop the rigorous skills necessary to contribute scholarly work to the field of cybersecurity policy and strategy in the future.

- My ambition is to build a career at the nexus of technology and national security. Upon graduation, I aim to join a government agency, such as Taiwan's National Cybersecurity Program, or an international organization like INTERPOL or a NATO-affiliated body. I want to serve as a strategist who can bridge the critical gap between technical analysts and policymakers.
- My ability to intimately understand the attackers' tools, combined with the strategic and criminological framework from the University of Portsmouth's MSc, will allow me to contribute to developing more effective national and international policies to deter and prosecute cybercrime and counter digital terrorism.
- I am confident that my unique blend of hands-on experience and my focused ambition makes me an ideal candidate for this program.
