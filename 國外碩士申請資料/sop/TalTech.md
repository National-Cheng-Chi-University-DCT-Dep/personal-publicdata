#### Body: Forging Expertise in High-Stakes Environments
My journey into cybersecurity began during my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at National Taiwan University, where I specialized in network security and data analytics. A pivotal project involved developing an AI-based intrusion detection system for simulated enterprise networks, earning top honors in our department's capstone competition. This academic foundation quickly translated into real-world impact when I joined TWSE as a junior cybersecurity specialist. Over two years, I contributed to securing critical infrastructure against evolving threats, including ransomware campaigns targeting financial APIs and insider risk assessments using behavioral analytics. One standout achievement was optimizing a cloud-based threat intelligence platform that reduced false positives by 40%, enabling faster response times during peak trading volumes. These efforts honed my skills in Python scripting, SIEM tools like Splunk, and machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, but they also exposed the limitations of siloed approaches: software defenses alone cannot counter hardware-level exploits or quantum-era vulnerabilities.

Beyond technical proficiency, my role at TWSE immersed me in cross-functional collaboration, where I briefed C-suite executives on risk mitigation strategies and coordinated with international partners during joint exercises modeled after global cyber drills. This experience underscored the need for a holistic perspective—one that integrates policy, ethics, and cutting-edge research. It was here that my interest in quantum computing crystallized; reading about Shor's algorithm's potential to shatter RSA encryption during a late-night threat modeling session, I became determined to pioneer quantum-resistant systems. Yet, with Taiwan's vibrant tech ecosystem demanding immediate expertise, I sought a master's program that would not only deepen my cybersecurity acumen but also bridge to quantum frontiers. TalTech, with its NATO-rooted legacy and forward-looking research hubs, represents that perfect convergence.

#### Bridge: Why TalTech—Aligning Passions with Pioneering Opportunities
In bridging my professional background and future aspirations, TalTech's MSc in Cybersecurity emerges as the ideal program to propel my career in cybersecurity while laying the groundwork for my long-term interest in quantum computing. With my experience providing cybersecurity services to critical sectors like the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), where I focused on threat detection and system resilience, I am drawn to TalTech's emphasis on practical, strategic approaches to national-level security challenges. This alignment is particularly evident in the expertise of Prof. Rain Ottis, Director of the Centre for Digital Forensics and Cyber Security and head of the Cybersecurity MSc program. His work in cyber conflicts, national cybersecurity, and leading the world's largest cyber exercise, Locked Shields, resonates deeply with my own encounters in protecting key infrastructure. I am eager to learn from his research on critical infrastructure protection, cybersecurity policy, and exercises, which will elevate my perspective from operational tactics to high-level strategic thinking.

Furthermore, TalTech's integration of AI in security through the Estonian Centre of Excellence in AI (EXAI)—a seven-year national initiative—offers unparalleled opportunities to explore AI-driven security systems, a direction I am passionate about advancing. Collaborating with professors like Rain Ottis and others in EXAI on end-to-end AI system security and privacy guarantees will allow me to apply AI in cybersecurity contexts, building on my prior work in risk management and enhancing public services through innovative technologies. Beyond algorithmic defenses, I believe that hardware is the cornerstone of a true defense-in-depth system, which is why TalTech’s research in hardware security is particularly compelling to me.

Complementing this, the program's unique hardware security focus addresses gaps in my software and cloud-based knowledge. Prof. Samuel Pagliarini's research in trusted integrated circuit (IC) design, hardware Trojan detection, circuit obfuscation, and countermeasures against reverse engineering provides a hardware-centric lens on security. As a former Director of the Centre for Hardware Security and now a visiting professor, his international competition successes, such as in HeLLo:CTF, inspire me to incorporate hardware safeguards into holistic cybersecurity strategies.

Beyond immediate cybersecurity mastery, TalTech supports my long-term pursuit of quantum computing by providing a robust foundation in post-quantum technologies—for me, this is more than just a technical challenge; it is about being part of the generation that will define the security of our future digital world. I am particularly excited to enroll in Prof. Ahto Buldas's ITC8240 Cryptography course (6 ECTS), which covers RSA, quantum-resistant cryptography, digital signatures, Shor's and Grover's algorithms, and their security implications. His expertise in cryptography, blockchain timestamps, and long-term security models—bolstered by collaborations like Guardtime's BLT signature scheme—will equip me with the theoretical and practical tools to tackle quantum threats.

TalTech's cutting-edge quantum software research further fuels this ambition. Prof. Amar Hadzihasanovic, Assistant Professor of Quantum Software, brings his background from Oxford, Kyoto, and Paris to advance quantum circuit diagrammatics, higher-dimensional rewriting systems, and formal methods, while serving as a consultant for Quantinuum. Similarly, Prof. Paweł Sobociński's Laboratory for Compositional Systems and Methods explores string diagrams in quantum computing, with PhD opportunities in "Diagrammatic Quantum Programming" that integrate ZX-calculus with functional programming paradigms. The Kvanttehnoloogia seminar serves as an excellent entry point for quantum programming basics, complementing the Computer Science MSc offerings and allowing me to build foundational skills in this emerging field.

Finally, TalTech's interdisciplinary ecosystem, exemplified by the CHESS Cyber-security Excellence Hub—a cross-border initiative with South Moravia (Czech Republic)—positions post-quantum cryptography as a key challenge area. This vibrant, multinational environment, encompassing IoT security, trusted software verification, blockchain, and human-centered cybersecurity, will enable me to engage in forward-thinking research on quantum-resistant systems. Through these resources, TalTech not only aligns with my cybersecurity goals but also bridges seamlessly to my quantum aspirations, fostering a comprehensive skill set for future innovations in secure technologies.
